            <h1>Disclaimer</h1>
            <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: December 15, 2025</p>

            <div class="legal-content">
                <h2>1. General Disclaimer</h2>
                <p>The information provided on the PrimeBridge Capital (PBC) website is for general informational purposes only. While we strive to provide accurate and up-to-date information, we make no representations or warranties of any kind, express or implied, about the completeness, accuracy, reliability, suitability, or availability of the information, products, services, or related graphics contained on the website.</p>

                <h2>2. Not Financial Advice</h2>
                <p>The content on this website does not constitute financial, legal, tax, or investment advice. You should consult with qualified professionals before making any financial decisions. PrimeBridge Capital is not responsible for any financial decisions you make based on information obtained from this website.</p>

                <h2>3. No Guarantee of Loan Approval</h2>
                <p>Submitting a loan application does not guarantee approval. All loan applications are subject to credit review, verification of information, and underwriting approval by our lending partners. Loan terms, interest rates, and approval are based on individual creditworthiness and other factors.</p>

                <h2>4. Rate and Term Variability</h2>
                <p>Interest rates, loan terms, fees, and other loan features mentioned on this website are subject to change without notice and may vary based on:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Credit score and credit history</li>
                    <li>Income and employment status</li>
                    <li>Debt-to-income ratio</li>
                    <li>Loan amount and term</li>
                    <li>Collateral and down payment</li>
                    <li>Market conditions</li>
                    <li>State regulations</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The rates and terms displayed on our website are for illustrative purposes and may not reflect the actual rates and terms you may receive.</p>

                <h2>5. Third-Party Lenders</h2>
                <p>PrimeBridge Capital acts as a loan broker and connects borrowers with third-party lenders. We do not control the lending decisions, terms, or conditions set by these lenders. Each lender has its own underwriting criteria, and approval by one lender does not guarantee approval by another.</p>

                <h2>6. Credit Impact</h2>
                <p>While initial rate quotes may use soft credit inquiries that do not affect your credit score, final loan approval requires a hard credit inquiry which may temporarily lower your credit score. Multiple credit inquiries within a short period may have a cumulative negative effect on your credit score.</p>

                <h2>7. External Links</h2>
                <p>Our website may contain links to external websites that are not operated by PrimeBridge Capital. We have no control over the content, privacy policies, or practices of these third-party sites and assume no responsibility for them. We strongly advise you to review the terms and privacy policies of any external sites you visit.</p>

                <h2>8. Website Accuracy and Availability</h2>
                <p>While we strive to maintain accurate and current information on our website, we do not warrant that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The website will be available at all times without interruption</li>
                    <li>All information is accurate, complete, or current</li>
                    <li>The website is free from errors, bugs, or viruses</li>
                    <li>Any defects will be corrected</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
                <p>PrimeBridge Capital, its officers, directors, employees, affiliates, and agents shall not be liable for any damages whatsoever, including but not limited to direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages, arising from:</p>

                    <li>Errors or omissions in website content</li>
                    <li>Unauthorized access to or alteration of your data</li>
                    <li>Statements or conduct of third parties on the website</li>
                    <li>Decisions made based on website information</li>
                    <li>Loan denials or unfavorable loan terms</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>10. Testimonials and Reviews</h2>
                <p>Testimonials and reviews displayed on our website represent individual experiences and may not be representative of all clients' experiences. Results may vary. Testimonials are not a guarantee of future performance or success.</p>

                <h2>11. Client and Investor Names</h2>
                <p>Any client or investor names mentioned on our website are for illustrative purposes only and do not represent actual clients or investors unless explicitly stated otherwise. These names are used to demonstrate the types of businesses and individuals we serve.</p>

                <h2>12. Statistical Information</h2>
                <p>Statistics, figures, and data presented on our website (such as "5,000+ clients" or "$1.2B+ funded") are based on our internal records and estimates. These figures are provided for informational purposes and may not reflect exact numbers.</p>

                <h2>13. Regulatory Compliance</h2>
                <p>PrimeBridge Capital strives to comply with all applicable federal and state lending laws and regulations. However, lending laws vary by state, and some products or services may not be available in all jurisdictions. It is your responsibility to ensure compliance with local laws.</p>

                <h2>14. Changes to Website and Services</h2>
                <p>We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue any aspect of our website or services at any time without notice. We are not liable for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the website or services.</p>

                <h2>15. Employment and Income Verification</h2>
                <p>We may verify employment and income information provided in your application. Providing false or misleading information may result in loan denial, loan termination, and potential legal consequences.</p>

                <h2>16. Collection and Legal Action</h2>
                <p>Failure to repay a loan may result in collection activities, negative credit reporting, legal action, and seizure of collateral (for secured loans). Default on a loan can significantly damage your credit score and affect your ability to obtain credit in the future.</p>

                <h2>17. Privacy and Data Security</h2>
                <p>While we implement reasonable security measures to protect your information, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security of your data. See our <a href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for more information.</p>

                <h2>18. Independent Contractor Relationship</h2>
                <p>Nothing in these terms creates a partnership, joint venture, employment, or agency relationship between you and PrimeBridge Capital. You may not bind PrimeBridge Capital or represent yourself as our representative.</p>

                <h2>19. Entire Agreement</h2>
