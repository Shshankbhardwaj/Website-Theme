                    <h2>About PrimeBridge Capital (PBC)</h2>
                    <p class="lead">Your Trusted Private Financing Partner</p>
                    <p>Founded over 15 years ago, PrimeBridge Capital (PBC) is a <strong>private financing company</strong> built on a simple principle: everyone deserves access to fair, transparent, and flexible capital solutions. Unlike traditional banks with rigid requirements and lengthy approval processes, we offer private financing options that are fast, flexible, and designed for real-world situations.</p>
                    <p>As a <strong>private lender</strong>, we've helped over 5,000 clients secure more than <strong>$1.2 billion in financing in 2025 alone</strong>. Our private capital solutions work when traditional financing doesn't - whether you have credit challenges, need fast funding, or require flexible terms that banks won't offer.</p>
                    <p>Our team of licensed loan specialists brings decades of combined experience in <strong>private financing and alternative lending</strong>. We don't just understand numbers and rates - we understand people. We know that behind every loan application is a real person with real dreams: a family looking for their first home, an entrepreneur ready to grow their business, or someone working hard to get out of debt and build a better future.</p>
                    <p>What truly sets us apart as a <strong>private financing company</strong> is our ability to provide solutions that traditional banks cannot. We offer flexible underwriting, fast approvals (often within 24 hours), and customized terms based on your specific situation - not just a credit score. Our private capital comes from a network of high-net-worth investors who understand that great opportunities don't always fit into a bank's rigid box.</p>
                    <p>We're proud to be fully licensed, regulated, and A+ rated by the Better Business Bureau. Our <strong>private lending solutions</strong> have helped thousands of individuals and businesses achieve their goals when traditional financing wasn't an option.</p>
