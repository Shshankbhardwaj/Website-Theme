            <h1>Important Disclosures</h1>
            <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: December 15, 2025</p>

            <div class="legal-content">
                <h2>1. General Lending Disclosures</h2>
                <p>PrimeBridge Capital (PBC) is a private financing company that arranges and provides loans through a network of private lenders and investors. We are not a traditional bank or credit union.</p>

                <h2>2. Loan Brokerage Services</h2>
                <p>PBC acts as a loan broker and may connect you with third-party lenders. We are compensated by lenders for our services. The terms of your loan, including interest rates and fees, will be determined by the lender who ultimately funds your loan.</p>

                <h2>3. Interest Rates and APR</h2>
                <p><strong>Variable Rates:</strong> Interest rates and Annual Percentage Rates (APR) are based on multiple factors including credit history, loan amount, loan term, and collateral. Rates may vary significantly based on individual circumstances.</p>
                <p><strong>Representative Example:</strong> A loan of $25,000 with a 5-year term at 8.99% APR would result in 60 monthly payments of approximately $518. Total amount repaid would be $31,080.</p>
                <p><strong>Rate Range:</strong> Our loans typically range from 3.99% to 35.99% APR depending on creditworthiness and loan type.</p>

                <h2>4. Fees and Charges</h2>
                <p>Fees may include but are not limited to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Origination Fee:</strong> 0% to 6% of loan amount</li>
                    <li><strong>Application Fee:</strong> $0 to $500 (if applicable)</li>
                    <li><strong>Processing Fee:</strong> $0 to $300</li>
                    <li><strong>Late Payment Fee:</strong> 5% of missed payment or $25, whichever is greater</li>
                    <li><strong>Returned Payment Fee:</strong> $25 to $50</li>
                    <li><strong>Prepayment Penalty:</strong> May apply to certain loans (disclosed in loan agreement)</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>5. Credit Authorization</h2>
                <p>By submitting an application, you authorize PrimeBridge Capital and its lending partners to:</p>
                <ul>

                    <li>Contact your employer to verify employment and income</li>
                    <li>Share your information with potential lenders and investors</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Credit Inquiries:</strong> Initial rate quotes may use a soft inquiry that does not affect your credit score. Final loan approval requires a hard inquiry which may temporarily impact your credit score.</p>

                <h2>6. No Guarantee of Approval</h2>
                <p>Submitting an application does not guarantee loan approval. All applications are subject to credit review and underwriting approval. Approval rates and loan terms vary based on individual circumstances.</p>
